# CFG-Generator
A random CFG generator which can be used to test some compiler algorithm on cfg and to generate random programs.

Also the program can output the following:

1. Dominate Tree of the CFG
2. File Format for mcl software [http://micans.org/mcl/] to analysis the CFG
3. File Format for snap software [http://snap.stanford.edu/index.html] to analysis the CFG

TO BE DONE:

1. Structure anslysis of the CFG
2. Graph Isomorphism detection between two CFGs
3. Topological Embedding of Graphs  [Directed graph pattern matching and topological embedding]
